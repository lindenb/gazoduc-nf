/**

https://github.com/DecodeGenetics/graphtyper

graphtyper is a graph-based variant caller capable of genotyping population-scale short read data sets. It represents a reference genome and known variants of a genomic region using an acyclic graph structure (a "pangenome reference"), which high-throughput sequence reads are re-aligned to for the purpose of discovering and genotyping SNPs, small indels, and structural variants.
